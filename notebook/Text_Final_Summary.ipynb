jeff l. carter, plaintiff-intervenor, case no. wendell a. miles v robert bosch corporation, defendant. __________________________________________/ opinion and order on defendant’s motion for summary judgment plaintiff the equal employment opportunity commission (“eeoc”) filed this action against defendant robert bosch corporation (“bosch” or “the company”), alleging that bosch violated title vii of the civil rights act of 1964, as amended, 42 u.s.c. the eeoc’s claim is that bosch discriminated against a former employee, on the basis of his religion, by requiring him to work overtime on his sabbath day and terminating him after he accumulated unexcused absences by refusing to work the scheduled overtime. the former employee, jeff carter, has been granted leave to intervene as a plaintiff in the action. the matter is currently before the court a motion by bosch for summary judgment (docket no. both the eeoc and carter have opposed the motion. for the reasons to follow, the court grants the motion. i jeff carter, who became employed by bosch in july, 1997, is a member of the old path church of god, inc. the church observes a sabbath from sundown fridays until sundown saturdays. from the beginning of his employment until january, 2002, carter worked in bosch’s foundry on either the first or third shift (monday through friday, 7, 00 a.m. to 3, 00 p.m. or sunday through thursday, 11, 00 p.m. to 7, 00 a.m., respectively), positions which presented no difficulties for him in observing his sabbath. according to carter, one of his supervisors in the foundry accommodated his desire not to work his sabbath by finding volunteers to cover carter’s overtime shifts (11, 00 p.m. friday to 7, 00 a.m. saturday). during the time that carter worked for bosch, the company had in effect a collective bargaining agreement (“cba”) with local 383 of the international union of automobile workers of america (“the union”). in early january, 2002, carter, who had always worked in the company’s foundry, was “bumped” from his shift by another employee having more seniority under the cba. for the first time, carter was required to work second shift, consisting of the hours from 3, 00 p.m. to 11, 00 p.m. monday through friday. after some initial difficulties, the union was ultimately to negotiate on carter’s behalf for an accommodation with bosch which required carter to “bid off” second shift, but in the meantime permitting carter to trade shifts with another associate on fridays. in april, 2002, carter successfully bid on a third shift position in the company’s machine shop, requiring him to leave the foundry, where he had always worked. this third shift position allowed carter to observe his sabbath without difficulty, which he did until july, however, in july, 2002, bosch’s machine shop began operating at “100%” capacity. there is no dispute that this meant that the machine shop operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, requiring mandatory overtime. it was at this time that carter’s observance of his sabbath began to conflict with bosch’s overtime work requirement, it is undisputed that carter became obligated to work on a number of saturdays. the union’s cba with bosch contained a provision requiring “equalization of overtime.” in essence, this provision required the company, to the extent practicable, to equalize overtime within each job, department, and pay group, unless – and this is an important unless – the union and company agreed otherwise. this provision also required that the employee in an overtime group with the lowest number of overtime hours on a shift would be scheduled to work, qualifications permitting. in other words, employees with the least number of accumulated overtime hours had to be given overtime before their co-workers could again be required by the company to work overtime. the cba contained provisions for the posting of substitute overtime sign-up lists to reduce mandatory overtime and to help equalize “out of class” overtime. these provisions required an employee to complete a form provided by the company in order to “volunteer” for “out of class” overtime in another department. eeoc’s brief in opposition, exhibit 6 (article xvi of cba), at 48- beginning in july, 2002, carter alleges, he attempted to exercise options available to him under the cba in order to avoid saturday overtime. this included taking what the cba denoted “paid absence allowance” time off (or “paas”), consisting of a total of 64 hours, 40 of which could be taken without prior approval by the company. at some point, the union became involved in seeking to reach an accommodation with bosch which would enable carter to avoid saturday overtime. however, the union did not reach an agreement with bosch. on september 16, 2002, bosch fired carter for accumulating four unexcused absences, three of which resulted from carter’s refusal to work overtime on saturdays while the machine shop was operating at 100% capacity. carter subsequently filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc. on september 29, 2003, the eeoc filed this action, alleging that bosch had violated carter’s rights under title vii by failing to provide him with a reasonable accommodation of his known sincerely-held religious beliefs and by terminating him because his beliefs conflicted with an employment requirement. discovery in the action is now complete, and the company’s motion is now ripe for decision. ii in its motion, bosch argues that unless and until the supreme court reverses its decisions in ansonia bd. v. philbrook, 479 u.s. 60, 107 s.ct. 367 ( and trans world airlines, inc. v. hardison, 432 u.s. 63, 97 s.ct. 2264 (, neither the eeoc nor carter has a viable claim against the company for religious discrimination under title vii. summary judgment is proper where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" in evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must determine \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" anderson v. liberty lobby, inc., 477 u.s. 242, 251-52 (. the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of establishing the non-existence of any genuine issue of material fact and may satisfy this burden by \"\\'showing\\'--that is, pointing out to the district court--that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\\'s case.\" celotex corp. v. catrett, 477 u.s. 317, 325 (. while inferences drawn from the underlying facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, \"[w]hen the moving party has carried its burden under rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\" co. v. zenith radio corp., 475 u.s. 574, 586 (. only factual disputes which may have an effect on the outcome of a lawsuit under the applicable substantive law are \"material.\" anderson, 477 u.s. at title vii makes it unlawful for an employer “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual’s . under the statute, the term ‘religion’ includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee\\'s or prospective employee\\'s religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\\'s business. § 2000e(j).1 according to sixth circuit case law, the analysis of any religious accommodation case begins with the question of whether the employee has established a prima facie case of religious discrimination. such a case is established when an employee shows that, ( he holds a sincere religious belief that conflicts with an employment requirement, ( he has informed the employer about the conflicts, and ( he was discharged or disciplined for failing to comply with the conflicting employment requirement. smith v. pyro mining co., 827 f.2d 1081, 1085 (6th cir. once the 1as the supreme court has observed, the “reasonable accommodation duty” was incorporated “somewhat awkwardly” into title vii in 1972, through the addition of the definition of “religion.” ansonia bd. v. philbrook, 479 u.s. 60, 63 n.1, 107 s.ct. plaintiff has established a prima facie case, “[t]he burden then shifts to the employer to ( conclusively rebut one or more elements of the plaintiff’s prima facie case, ( show that it offered a reasonable accommodation, or ( show that it was unable reasonably to accommodate the employee’s religious needs without undue hardship.” thomas v. national ass’n of letter carriers, 225 f.3d 1149, 1156 (10th cir. once an employer has offered a single reasonable accommodation, it has fulfilled its obligation under title vii. mcguire v. general motors corp., 956 f.2d 607, 609 (6th cir. the employer is not required to choose the accommodation favored by the employee, or any particular accommodation for that matter, instead, “[b]y its very terms [title vii] directs that any reasonable accommodation by the employer is sufficient to meet its accommodation obligation.” ansonia, 479 u.s. at 68, 107 s.ct. at “thus, where the employer has already reasonably accommodated the employee’s religious needs, the statutory inquiry is at an end. the employer need not further show that each of the employee’s alternative accommodations would result in undue hardship.” id., see thomas, 225 f.3d at 1156 n.7 (“the employer does not have to demonstrate that the particular accommodation requested by the employee would result in an undue hardship”). the employer is not required “to consider and preclude an infinite number of possible accommodations.” id., 225 f.3d at bosch does not dispute that the eeoc and carter have established a prima facie case. bosch also does not contend that it was unable reasonably to accommodate carter’s observance of his saturday sabbath without undue hardship. therefore, the only disputed aspect of the case for purposes of summary judgment is whether bosch has shown that it offered carter a reasonable accommodation. “the reasonableness of an employer’s attempt to accommodate is determined on a case-by-case basis.” cooper v. oak rubber co., 15 f.3d 1375, 1378 (6th cir. however, according to the eeoc’s own guidelines clarifying the obligation imposed by title vii, the use of voluntary substitutes and “swaps” is one means of accommodating a conflict between work schedules and religious practices. specifically, these guidelines provide that reasonable accommodation without undue hardship is generally possible where a voluntary substitute with substantially similar qualifications is available. one means of substitution is the voluntary swap. in a number of cases, the securing of a substitute has been left entirely up to the individual seeking the accommodation. the commission believes that the obligation to accommodate requires that employers and labor organizations facilitate the securing of a voluntary substitute with substantially similar qualifications. some means of doing this which employers and labor organizations should consider are, to publicize policies regarding accommodation and voluntary substitution, to promote an atmosphere in which such substitutions are favorably regarded, to provide a central file, bulletin board or other means for matching voluntary substitutes with positions for which substitutes are needed. the eeoc has conceded in this case, as it apparently must, that “voluntary swapping” of shifts is a reasonable accommodation. eeoc’s brief in opposition, at as noted above, bosch’s position is that the supreme court’s decisions in ansonia and hardison control here. in ansonia, the court held that “an employer has met its obligation under [42 u.s.c. § 2000e(j)] when it demonstrates that it offered a reasonable accommodation to the employee.” 479 u.s. at 69, 107 s.ct. in so holding, the court noted that a portion of the eeoc’s guidelines on religious discrimination which require the employer to choose an accommodation alternative which “least disadvantages an individual’s employment opportunities” is “simply inconsistent with the statute.” 479 u.s. at 69 n.6, 107 s.ct. at 372 n.6 (quoting 29 c.f.r. according to the court, “[b]y its very terms the statute directs that any reasonable accommodation by the employer is sufficient to meet its accommodation obligation.” 479 u.s. at 68, 107 s.ct. at the court concluded by remanding the case in view of “insufficient factual findings as to the manner in which the collective-bargaining agreements have been interpreted, ” although noting that an accommodation requiring the plaintiff to take unpaid leave as permitted by the collective bargaining agreement “would generally be a reasonable one.” 479 u.s. at 70, 107 s.ct. at ansonia therefore makes it clear that an employer need offer only one reasonable accommodation to fulfill its statutory obligation under title vii. earlier, in hardison, the court made it clear that employers covered by a collective bargaining agreement on a different footing than employers who are not bound by such an agreement. the issue in hardison was virtually identical to that presented here, “the extent of the employer’s obligation under title vii to accommodate an employee whose religious beliefs prohibit him from working on saturdays.” 432 u.s. at 66, 97 s.ct. at in that case, the department in which the plaintiff worked operated 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. whenever an employee’s job in that department was not filled, another employee would have to be shifted from another department, or a supervisor would have to cover the job, even if this caused the work in other areas to suffer. the collective bargaining agreement gave the most senior employees the first choice of job and shift assignments, and the most junior employees were required to work when the union steward was unable to find enough people willing to work at a particular time or in a particular time to fill the employer’s needs. 432 u.s. at 66-67, 97 s.ct. at when the plaintiff in hardison informed his department manager that his religion required that he refrain from working from sunset on friday until sunset on saturday, the manager agreed that the union steward should seek a job swap for plaintiff or a change of days off. however, the union was not willing to violate the collective bargaining agreement’s seniority provisions, and plaintiff had insufficient seniority to bid for a shift having saturdays off. 432 u.s. at 68, 97 s.ct. at in addition, the union steward reported that “he was unable to work out scheduling changes and that he understood that no one was willing to swap days with plaintiff.” 432 u.s. at 78, 97 s.ct. at 2273- when the employer and the union were unable to reach an accommodation, plaintiff refused to report for work on saturdays, and was ultimately discharged for insubordination. the court held that because collective bargaining “lies at the core of our national labor policy, ” which – like the duty to accommodate religious needs – is a matter of statute, the duty to accommodate does not require an employer “to take steps inconsistent with” an otherwise valid collective bargaining agreement. 432 u.s. at 80, 97 s.ct. at according to the court, because there were no volunteers to work saturdays in place of the plaintiff, to give the plaintiff saturdays off the employer “would have had to deprive another employee of his shift preference at least in part because he did not adhere to a religion that observed the saturday sabbath.” 432 u.s. at 81, 97 s.ct. at however, the court concluded, title vii does not contemplate such unequal treatment. the repeated, unequivocal emphasis of both the language and the legislative history of title vii is on eliminating discrimination in employment, and such discrimination is proscribed when it is directed against majorities as well as minorities. indeed, the foundation of [plaintiff]\\'s claim is that [the employer] and [the union] engaged in religious discrimination in violation of § 703(a)( [42 u.s.c. § 2000e-2(a)(] when they failed to arrange for him to have saturdays off. it would be anomalous to conclude that by ‘reasonable accommodation’ congress meant that an employer must deny the shift and job preference of some employees, as well as deprive them of their contractual rights, in order to accommodate or prefer the religious needs of others, and we conclude that title vii does not require an employer to go that far. 432 u.s. at 81, 97 s.ct. at the court held that the employer made reasonable efforts to accommodate by leaving to the union steward the task of finding someone who was willing to work for the plaintiff. 432 u.s. at 77-78, 97 s.ct. at in this case, the evidence clearly shows that bosch informally discussed with the union the possibility of allowing carter to trade shifts with another associate on fridays, an arrangement which had been in place when carter worked in the foundry.2 indeed, on july 29, 2002, after the machine shop began operating at 100% capacity requiring mandatory overtime but before carter had been charged with any unexcused absences in that position, benson james of bosch’s human resource department inquired by e-mail of sharene tyler, one of the union representatives, whether carter had “sought out another person to make an arrangement similar to the one he had in the foundry.” appendix to eeoc’s supplemental brief in opposition, exhibit according to james, he was following up on a previous conversation with tyler by asking her whether they might be able to work out an arrangement for carter to trade shifts, as had been done in the foundry. id., exhibit 17 (deposition of benson james), at 39-40, 45, 47- however, according to tyler, the union steward could not find anyone to work carter’s saturday overtime. id., exhibit 23 (deposition of sharene tyler) (“tyler dep.”), at 41, tyler 2this arrangement was memorialized an a “memorandum of agreement” (“moa”) signed by all the parties, including the union, dated march 18, eeoc’s brief in opposition, exhibit importantly, the moa placed the obligation on the union to “designate any voluntary associates” to take carter’s sabbath shifts, with the specification that the volunteers had to be “qualified to completely perform the duties of the job, as well as mr. carter being qualified to completely perform the duties of the job of the other voluntary associate.” id., ¶ however, by its terms, the moa only resolved a grievance which carter had filed while he was still working second shift in the foundry. eeoc’s brief in opposition, exhibit according to andre holmes, a member of the union’s bargaining committee, both bosch and the union agreed that carter’s new job on a different shift in another part of the company’s plant (the machine shop) involving mandatory overtime presented a “different” situation, rendering the moa no longer applicable. appendix to eeoc’s supplemental brief in opposition, exhibit 21 (deposition of andre holmes), at according to benson james, the union was objecting in general to the amount of overtime employees in the machine shop were being required to work on all shifts in the department. appendix to eeoc’s supplemental brief in opposition, exhibit 17 (deposition of benson james), at 77- also testified that carter even tried to help her to formulate a list of persons who would be willing to work as his sabbath replacement, but carter couldn’t find anyone who was willing to help him. at 47- tyler further testified that they even attempted to find “out of class” replacements for carter, but employees did not want to volunteer because they did not like to work for carter’s supervisor, sandra nedoba. id., at although carter testified that union bargaining committee member andre holmes told him that “he had a list” of employees who might be willing or able to work (it’s not clear which, or if both), appendix to eeoc’s supplemental brief in opposition, exhibit 18 (deposition of jeff carter), at 131-132, apparently the union did not itself bother to present this supposedly valid list to bosch before carter was fired for missing work on his sabbath multiple times. holmes himself testified that he personally never tried to find anyone to work carter’s overtime between july and september, id., exhibit 21 (deposition of andre holmes), at 3 carter does state, in his affidavit, that he asked his supervisor, sandra nedoba, whether he could “swap shifts with any volunteers, ” expressly mentioning the moa that had been negotiated in the foundry. eeoc’s brief in opposition, exhibit 2 (declaration of jeff carter), ¶ carter was not certain of the date of this conversation, stating that it could have occurred 3holmes’ april 14, 2004 testimony is consistent in this regard with his affidavit which the eeoc filed with its original brief in opposition. according to holmes’ earlier affidavit, dated january 9, 2004, in which he stated that although the union “was willing to assist in the development of qualified volunteers from ‘out of class’, ” employees, the union did not actually produce such a list until after carter had been fired and the union was negotiating his return to work, and even then the negotiations pertained to carter’s return to a position in the foundry, not the machine shop. eeoc’s brief in opposition, exhibit 3 (declaration of andre holmes) (“holmes aff.”), at 4, ¶s 9-10, see id., exhibits 30, 31 (union proposal and draft memorandum of agreement, respectively, providing for carter’s return to work in the foundry after his discharge). in his affidavit, holmes confirmed that although the negotiations for carter’s return were for other reasons unsuccessful, “bosch was willing to accept this list” of volunteers. at 4, ¶ “[i]n late july or early august, 2002[. not surprisingly, nedoba replied in the negative, and, according to carter, informed him that “the swapping arrangement [carter] had in the foundry will not be allowed in the machine shop.” id. however, what is clear is that nedoba and carter lacked the authority to directly negotiate with each other to formulate an arrangement for carter’s excusal from saturday overtime, instead, the company had to negotiate through the union, as carter’s exclusive bargaining representative. see, e.g., national labor relations bd. co., 388 u.s. 175, 180, 87 s.ct. 2001, 2006 ( (national labor policy “extinguishes the individual employee’s power to order his own relations with his employer and creates a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the interests of all employees”), virts v. consolidated freightways corp. of delaware, 285 f.3d 508, 519 (6th cir. (because employees were represented by labor organization, employer was prohibited from direct dealing with employees to solicit voluntary swaps of runs), see also clarett v. national football league, 369 f.3d 124, 138 (2d cir. (because football players were unionized, labor law prohibited player from negotiating directly the terms and conditions of his employment directly with any potential employer). in any case, what neither the eeoc nor carter explains is how they could have formulated a list of employees willing to work overtime in the machine shop, when the department was in a 100% capacity situation and overtime was already mandatory for other employees in addition to carter. the eeoc at one point dismisses the issue of accommodation through use of volunteers, arguing that “james would not consider allowing the use of the swapping arrangement (volunteer trades) . in the machine shop as an accommodation for carter.” eeoc’s brief in opposition, at in support of this argument, made in its initial brief filed before the completion of discovery, the eeoc cites to the affidavit of sharene tyler, who states, “the union requested, but james did not agree, to the institution of volunteer swaps.” id., exhibit 8 (declaration of sharene tyler), ¶ however, when her deposition was subsequently taken, tyler admitted that benson james “said we can get volunteers from out of class.” eeoc’s supplemental brief in opposition, exhibit 23 (deposition of sharene tyler) (“tyler dep.”), at in its supplemental brief in opposition, the eeoc apparently realizes that there is evidence contradicting its earlier position that use of volunteers was denied, for the eeoc argues that “conflicting testimony between carter and nedoba raises an issue of fact as to whether carter was denied the request to trade shifts by his direct supervisor.” id. at however, once again, this evidence of supposed direct discussions between carter and nedoba ignores the legal requirement that bosch negotiate with the union on the issue of relieving an employee from the burden imposed by the contractual requirement of equalization of overtime.4 the eeoc skirts over the issue of the lack of available volunteers to work overtime for carter in the machine shop – blaming it on the company – and instead focuses its arguments on what it contends was a failure by bosch to schedule formal negotiations with the union to discuss the issue of “swapping.” eeoc’s supplemental brief in opposition, at the eeoc also argues, relying on tyler’s testimony, that james told the union that “voluntary swapping 4what the eeoc also apparently fails to realize is that the issue of limited shift “swaps” negotiated between employees presented a different question than the procurement of volunteers from a list formulated by the union and the company. sharene tyler testified that these were different practices. at there is evidence that bosch permitted the practice of employees “swapping” shifts with each other, for example, an employee assigned to work a particular time could find another employee to work for him. however, this would have been a week-to-week measure, virtually amounting to no accommodation at all. see equal employment opportunity comm’n v. arlington transit mix, inc., 957 f.2d 219, 222 (6th cir. (company’s adoption of “week-to-week, wait-and-see posture . amounted to no accommodation at all”). what bosch could not do, absent an agreement with the union, was to simply excuse an employee from working overtime and proceed to require another employee to perform in his co-worker’s place. was not an option and denied her request to negotiate a swapping [agreement] for the machine shop.” id. at however, a review of this cited testimony reveals that tyler admitted that james told her “the union and [carter] needed to find someone to cover him[. at if no formal meeting was held on the question, it was because no volunteers were found to work for carter in the machine shop on his sabbath. tyler admitted not only that she instructed the union steward to make sure that an “out of class” volunteer list was posted, but also that the steward “took the list down and went to each individual that was there.” tyler dep. at 127- it is clear, based on this testimony, that no one was willing to sign the volunteer list to work overtime for carter on saturdays in the machine shop. reply brief supporting bosch’s motion for summary judgment, excerpt from tyler dep. at 42-44, 76- under the controlling supreme court authority of hardison, bosch cannot be held liable because no one was willing to volunteer. 432 u.s. at 81, 97 s.ct. at in its supplemental brief in opposition, the eeoc argues that bosch should also have initiated formal negotiations with the union to pursue other options for accommodation, including allowing carter to use his remaining paa days. however, even if this could be considered a reasonable accommodation – and there are serious doubts whether it could be, insofar as this would have been a week-to-week measure which would soon be exhausted5 – bosch was not required to offer more than one reasonable accommodation. in sum, the evidence shows that bosch offered the option of using volunteers to work 5the eeoc does not adequately address why carter’s use of his remaining paa days would have been a reasonable accommodation if there was still no one either willing or available to work overtime for carter in the event that he was granted permission to use these paas to avoid saturday overtime. this would have still left bosch with an absence to fill during those times when mandatory overtime was required to keep the department running at 100% capacity. overtime for carter on his sabbath, that there were no volunteers, and that the use of volunteers is, as a matter of law, a reasonable accommodation, even where the employee’s collective bargaining representative cannot find volunteers willing or able to volunteer. under the circumstances, bosch is entitled to summary judgment in its favor. conclusion for the foregoing reasons, the court grants the motion for summary judgment. judgment will be entered accordingly. so ordered this 21st day of october, /s/ wendell a. miles wendell a. miles senior u.s. district judge united states district court western district of michigan southern division equal employment opportunity commission, plaintiff, and jeff l. carter, plaintiff-intervenor, case no. wendell a. miles v robert bosch corporation, defendant. __________________________________________/ opinion and order on plaintiff eeoc’s motion for reconsideration plaintiff the equal employment opportunity commission (“eeoc”) filed this action against defendant robert bosch corporation (“bosch” or “the company”), alleging that bosch violated title vii of the civil rights act of 1964, as amended, 42 u.s.c. the eeoc’s claim is that bosch discriminated against a former employee, jeff carter, on the basis of his religion by requiring him to work overtime on his sabbath day and terminating him after he accumulated unexcused absences by refusing to work the scheduled overtime. carter has been granted leave to intervene as a plaintiff in the action. on october 21, 2004, the court issued a decision granting bosch’s motion for summary judgment. the matter is currently before the court on motions by both carter and the eeoc for reconsideration (docket nos. 84 and of that decision. for the reasons to follow, the court denies the motions. discussion in its lengthy opinion and order (docket no., the court concluded that bosch was entitled to summary judgment because the evidence showed that bosch had offered the option of using volunteers to work overtime for carter on his sabbath, that there were no volunteers, and that the use of volunteers was, as a matter of law, a reasonable accommodation, even though the employee’s collective bargaining representative – here, local 383 of the international union of automobile workers of america (“the union”) – could not find volunteers willing or able to volunteer. in its motion, the eeoc expressly relies on fed.r.civ.p. 4(a).1 a district court may grant reconsideration under fed.r.civ.p. 59(e) for any of four reasons, ( because of an intervening change in the controlling law, ( because evidence not previously available has become available, ( to correct a clear error of law, or ( to prevent manifest injustice. see gencorp, inc. v. american int\\'l underwriters, 178 f.3d 804, 834 (6th cir.. in addition, w.d. 4(a) provides that a movant seeking reconsideration “shall not only demonstrate a palpable defect by which the court and the parties have been misled, but also show that a different disposition of the case must result from a correction thereof.”2 1in his own motion for reconsideration, carter merely joins in the arguments made by the eeoc. 2the eeoc’s brief (docket no. filed in support of its motion for reconsideration (continued...) 2 in support of its request for relief, the eeoc raises a number of arguments, which can essentially be divided into two separate categories, ( the court erred in concluding that the supreme court’s opinions in ansonia bd. v. philbrook, 479 u.s. 60, 107 s.ct. 367 ( and trans world airlines, inc. v. hardison, 432 u.s. 63, 97 s.ct. 2264 ( supported the entry of summary judgment in favor of bosch, and ( the court erred in concluding that the facts of record supported that decision. in its decision granting summary judgment in favor of bosch, the court concluded that the issue in hardison was virtually identical to that presented here, “the extent of the employer’s obligation under title vii to accommodate an employee whose religious beliefs prohibit him from working on saturdays.” opinion and order at 8 (citing hardison, 432 u.s. at 66, 97 s.ct. in hardison, the supreme court observed that the seniority system contemplated by the collective bargaining agreement “itself represented a significant accommodation to the needs, both religious and secular, of all [the company’s] employees” because such a system “represents a neutral way of minimizing the number of occasions when an employee must work on a day that he would prefer to have off.” id., 432 u.s. at 78, 97 s.ct. at according to the court, its conclusion was “supported by the fact that seniority systems are afforded special treatment under title vii itself[, ]” namely under 42 u.s.c. hardison, 432 u.s. at 81-82, 97 s.ct. 2(...continued) consists of 27 pages of text, which not only exceeds the number of pages contained in its earlier brief in response (25 pages, docket no., but also exceeds the number of pages permitted by local rules for dispositive motions. despite its length, the brief contains three footnotes (8, 9, and which appear to be incomplete. although the local rules do not precisely specify page limits for briefs submitted in support of motions for reconsideration, the rules do provide that motions “which merely present the same issues ruled upon by the court shall not be granted.” w.d. 3 at the court reiterated that it was concluding that the company “was not required by title vii to carve out a special exception to its seniority system in order to help [the plaintiff] to meet his religious obligations.” id., 432 u.s. at 83, 97 s.ct. at in construing similarly worded statutes, the supreme court has noted that neutral seniority systems – collectively bargained or otherwise – are generally sufficient to show reasonable accommodation. see u.s. airways, inc. v. barnett, 535 u.s. 391, 403-405, 122 s.ct. 1516, 1524-1525 ( (construing americans with disabilities act). in this case, the union’s collective bargaining agreement (“cba”) with bosch contained a provision requiring “equalization of overtime.” this provision also required that an employee in an overtime group with the lowest number of overtime hours on a shift would be scheduled to work, qualifications permitting. in other words, employees with the least number of accumulated overtime hours had to be given overtime before their co-workers could again be required by the company to work overtime. the cba contained provisions for the posting of substitute overtime sign-up lists to reduce mandatory overtime and to help equalize “out of class” overtime. in addition, the cba also permitted employees to “volunteer” for “out of class” overtime in another department by completing a required form. eeoc’s brief in opposition, exhibit 6 (article xvi of cba), at 48- the cba’s requirement for “equalization” of overtime essentially amounted to an objective, neutral system in which the number of accumulated overtime hours was the primary consideration in determining who would be assigned overtime – if other arrangements could not be made with “out-of-class” employees on a purely voluntary basis. the system was much like that contemplated by hardison, representing a “neutral way of minimizing the number of occasions when an employee must work on a day that he would prefer to have off.” see id., 432 4 u.s. at 78, 97 s.ct. at generally, a company’s use of a “neutral system such as seniority, a lottery, or rotating shifts” will establish reasonable accommodation. hardison, 432 u.s. at 80, 97 s.ct. at the eeoc argues that neither hardison or ansonia permit an employer to avoid liability by proposing an accommodation that “does not work.” according to the eeoc, in order to be reasonable, an accommodation has to completely eliminate the conflict between the employee’s work obligations and his religious ones. however, neither hardison nor ansonia holds that title vii requires an employer to completely eliminate all conflicts. nor does smith v. pyro mining co., 827 f.2d 1081 (6th cir., on which the eeoc relies. in smith, the sixth circuit considered “whether an employer reasonably accommodates an employee by allowing the employee to arrange a shift trade himself when the employee considers it a sin to arrange such a swap.” id. at a majority of the panel in smith concluded that this was not a reasonable accommodation. however, neither the eeoc nor carter has contended that carter considered it a “sin” for carter, or the union acting on his behalf, to seek other employees to work for carter on his sabbath. moreover, the decision in smith contains no indication that the employer was subject to a collective bargaining agreement. smith simply does not require the conclusion that only an accommodation which eliminates all conflict between employment and religious observance is reasonable. as one court has noted, any voluntary system is at the mercy of its volunteers, the system will not work perfectly should co-workers be unwilling to swap. however, despite this possibility that voluntary swaps will not always resolve a scheduling conflict, courts have held that the programs are reasonable accommodations. 1156, 1161 (n.d. ill. . the eeoc concedes, as it did previously, that seeking other employees to volunteer to 5 work carter’s sabbath shifts is generally a reasonable accommodation. eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration at however, the eeoc now contends, this accommodation was not reasonable under the facts of this case because bosch did not do enough to make sure the accommodation succeeded. according to the eeoc, “bosch’s overtime volunteer process was not reasonable because it was not an effective means for securing volunteers to cover for carter’s sabbath absences, largely because of bosch’s failure to cooperate in the process.” id. at 7-3 the court presumes that the eeoc’s argument that the volunteer process was not “effective” represents, in part, a concession that no employees volunteered to work for carter on his sabbath. apart from this, however, the argument that no one volunteered because bosch somehow failed to live up to the requirements of the cba is not supported by evidence that would be admissible at trial. the cba provided that a weekend overtime “sign-up sheet will consistently be posted as practicable in each given area of the plant, and will be facilitated in the same manner as the daily overtime.” cba at 50, appendix to eeoc’s brief in opposition, exhibit although the eeoc relies on hearsay testimony of union representative sharene 3the eeoc argues that the employer’s conduct is relevant in determining whether an employer’s accommodation is reasonable, citing mcguire v. general motors corp., 956 f.2d 607 (6th cir. in mcguire, the court concluded that the issue of reasonable accommodation could not be decided on summary judgment, where the employer responded to a union complaint that the plaintiff was being skipped for overtime duty by “surveying” other employees about plaintiff’s situation. specifically, the employer asked employees to complete two written “surveys” which asked in part whether they favored the plaintiff being given his saturdays off. most of the employees responded negatively, even though plaintiff had previously been able to use vacations, time-off days, and shift swaps to successfully avoid working on his sabbath for a six-month period. 956 f.2d at 608- the plaintiff argued successfully on appeal that the surveys presented a new situation, making it virtually impossible for him to find volunteers, and the court agreed that the purpose and/or effect of the surveys raised questions of fact, which should be considered in addition to the question of whether the plaintiff himself failed to seek volunteers. 956 f.2d at the eeoc has pointed to nothing done by bosch in this case which can be equated with the “surveys” conducted by the employer in mcguire. 6 tyler as support for its argument that the overtime lists were not posted between july and september, 2002, see tyler dep. at 118, appendix to eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration, exhibit 37, tyler in fact testified that she personally could not say whether the lists were posted or not during that time period because she “wasn’t the steward on the floor at that time.” id. at tyler was specifically asked the following, “so you don’t know whether or not out of class lists were being posted during that period or not?” she answered “no, i don’t.” id. at tyler was also asked, “do you ever recall a specific time during that period of time where you went to the bulletin board and the list wasn’t there?” she answered, “no, i did not go to the board. the steward handles the floor so he did the checking as far as what’s on the board and checking overtime.” id. at the union steward at the time was willie dumas. the eeoc did not submit an affidavit or testimony of dumas in opposing bosch’s motion, although it now relies in part on his testimony in support of its motion for reconsideration. dumas dep., appendix to eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration, exhibit according to the eeoc, the parties entered into a stipulation that dumas could be deposed after the close of discovery “[d]ue to difficulties in serving [him] with a subpoena before the close of discovery[. ]” eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration at 8 n. in its brief filed opposing bosch’s motion after the close of discovery, the eeoc did not indicate that it anticipated a need to rely on dumas’ testimony. the eeoc likewise failed to file an affidavit as provided by fed.r.civ.p. 56(f) after the close of discovery. notwithstanding these failures, the eeoc now argues that dumas’ testimony is “newly discovered evidence.” the testimony of a witness cannot be deemed “newly discovered” where a party is aware of that witness before entry of summary judgment but simply fails to protect itself as required by 7 fed.r.civ.p. however, even if dumas’ testimony may properly be considered in support of the eeoc’s motion for reconsideration, the testimony is at best cumulative and at worst supports bosch’s position, insofar as dumas confirms that he found no volunteers to work for carter on his sabbath. according to dumas, during july through september, 2002, the supervisors in carter’s department posted that they were “100-percent scheduled, ” including for saturdays. at as far as attempting to recruit out-of-class volunteers, dumas admitted that he “did not really pursue that process” because, being a “new steward at the time, he was “unfamiliar with that system.” id. at 32- at one point, before he had become union steward, he apparently believed – mistakenly – that it was the supervisors who were supposed to find coverage. once he became steward, however, he was disabused of this notion, and on different occasions he did attempt to recruit volunteers. at only once did dumas specifically ask that a list be posted, and when he did ask, this was done. dumas was also given some volunteer slips completed by employees, to whom he talked about working overtime. he could not remember whether any of them actually agreed to work on a particular day, although he admitted that he “didn’t have much luck finding coverage, because other departments were doing a lot of overtime at the time too.” id. at 37- dumas testified that “people pretty much got burnt out on overtime, and so . when they got the opportunity to be off, they would be off.” id. at at times when dumas did find willing volunteers to work outof-class overtime, there was no problem with the supervisors accepting the volunteers. at according to dumas, he looked for volunteers only on third shift, primarily because he was the steward for that shift, the other two shifts had their own stewards. at 52, 4 4to the best of the court’s knowledge, the eeoc has not relied on affidavits or testimony (continued...) 8 the eeoc argues that bosch should have provided a “safety net” for dumas’ “inexperience” by meeting its “contractual obligation to get involved in the search for out-ofclass volunteers[. ]” eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration at the eeoc argues that bosch was also obligated by eeoc guidelines to “facilitate the securing” of qualified volunteers. however, the cba expressly provides that “management may utilize the assistance of a union official to ask employees on the list when needed.” cba at dumas’ testimony confirms that this was what occurred. § 2, on which the eeoc relies, places duties on both employers and labor organizations. subsection (d)((i) of that guideline, on which the eeoc specifically relies, suggests various means of facilitating the use of volunteers, most of which are incorporated into the cba and were used without success here.5 simply put, the eeoc’s argument that bosch should have relied less on the union to secure volunteers is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the obligations of an employer subject to a cba and on a lack of familiarity with the particular cba provisions which governed carter’s employment in this case. further indication of this misunderstanding is found in the eeoc’s argument that bosch should have entered into a separate agreement with the union – or “memorandum of agreement” (“moa”) – which somehow accommodated carter. however, because the union never indicated that it was willing to waive the cba provisions regarding the assignment out-of-class overtime on a voluntary basis, the possibility of entering 4(...continued) of the union stewards for the other two shifts. 5the eeoc also argues that certain bosch supervisors “hindered” the union’s ability to secure volunteers because they required that out-of-class volunteers be trained. however, not only does the cba contemplate that such volunteers will be trained, but the eeoc guidelines also recognize that volunteers will have “substantially similar qualifications.” cba at 55, 29 c.f.r. 9 into an moa with the union required the procurement by the union of a list of qualified volunteers – which the union did not do.6 (the eeoc’s own submissions indicate that the union informed that company that a written agreement – such as one which the union negotiated for carter when he worked in the foundry – was not possible because the union could not find anyone who was willing to swap with carter. at 49-50, 56-57, exhibit 37, appendix to eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration.) under the circumstances, the eeoc’s attempt to distinguish this case from hardison fails. see id., 432 u.s. at 78, 97 s.ct. at 2273-2274 (employer agreed to permit union steward to seek swap of shifts, but steward reported he was unable to work out schedule changes and found no one willing to swap with the employee). the eeoc also repeats other arguments it made before summary judgment, including its arguments that bosch should have explored additional means of accommodation, and that other means of accommodation were available which did not pose an undue hardship on bosch. however, as this court has already noted, ansonia holds that an employer is not required to consider and preclude all of the employee’s proposed alternatives, only one reasonable accommodation suffices to fulfill an employer’s statutory duty. opinion and order at in any 6the eeoc’s brief in support states that “a list of qualified volunteers could have been part of the moa[. at this statement is followed by a footnote citing to dumas’ testimony for the proposition that a supervisor told dumas “a few volunteers were coming forward.” id. at 17 n. however, the eeoc has not identified any volunteers by name, nor has it shown that such persons were available to work carter’s shifts. according to dumas, first priority was given to covering medical absences, and then to employees who exercised their right, afforded under the cba, to be excused from scheduled overtime for up to 48 hours per year. at 56-57, cba at interestingly, footnote 8 of the eeoc’s supporting brief contains the following boldface statement, which appears to be an internal note of the brief’s author inadvertently included in the final draft filed with the court, “cite other evidence volunteers were available.” this “other evidence” is not, however, cited by the eeoc. 10 event, what is clear is that bosch had already accommodated carter’s observance of his sabbath in other ways, including permitting him to bid into a new position and excusing him from 48 hours of overtime on his sabbath, pursuant to the cba. the cba afforded all union employees “the right to be excused from scheduled overtime for up to forty-eight ( hours per year.” cba at plaintiff utilized all of the 48 hours on the following dates in 2002, july 27, august 10, august 17, august 24, august 31, and september exhibit 7, appendix to eeoc’s brief in opposition.7 the eeoc also argues that the court’s ruling was based in part on a “misunderstanding” of the facts and record, in a number of respects. these include the following, ( the court found as “undisputed fact that the entire machine shop was operating at 100% mandatory overtime capacity”, ( the court “mistakenly concluded” that volunteers could not be found to cover for carter, ( the court was supposedly under a mistaken “impression” that the union had generated a list of volunteers but failed to present it to bosch before carter was fired, and ( the court “mistakenly found” that benson james, a company human resources representative, “involved himself” in efforts to accommodate carter. 7the eeoc contends that carter was also entitled to use additional “personal absence allowance” (“paa”) days, which could have allowed him to avoid the unexcused absences resulting in his termination. (this is an interesting argument, considering that the evidence shows that not long before he was terminated, carter objected to using his “paa” days to observe his sabbath. specifically, in august, 2002 he filed a grievance against bosch in which he argued that two of the “paa” days he had already used on his sabbath should be “returned to him.” exhibit 9, appendix to eeoc’s brief in opposition.) however, paa’s are covered in a separate article of the cba – article xviii – which does not address overtime. cba at 58- article xvi of the cba, in contrast with article xviii, expressly addresses the subject of overtime and permits employees only 48 hours per year of unpaid leave from overtime. carter’s attendance record seems to indicate that he was paid for his 48 hours of excused overtime, even though the cba specifies that this time is to be treated as unpaid leave. exhibit 7, appendix to eeoc’s brief in opposition. what is clear, however, is that carter used all of the excused overtime hours which the cba permitted him to take. 11 the eeoc does not explain how any of these supposed “mistakes” resulted in an incorrect application of the law. in its ruling on bosch’s motion for summary judgment, the court did not find any facts at all, rather, the court merely determined whether, as provided by fed.r.civ.p. 56(c), genuine issues remained as to any material facts. not all factual disputes are “material.” instead, materiality is define with reference to the applicable substantive law. anderson v. liberty lobby, inc., 477 u.s. 242, 248, 106 s.ct. in its decision granting summary judgment in favor of bosch, the court did note that the parties did not dispute that the machine shop, where carter worked, began operating “100% capacity” in july, opinion and order at this statement is taken virtually verbatim from the eeoc’s own submissions. see declaration of jeffery l. carter, exhibit 2, appendix to eeoc’s brief in opposition (docket no., ¶ 7 (“in july 2002, after both plants were shut down, the machine shop began operating in a 100% situation. this meant that the machine shop operated 24 hours a day and seven days a week, requiring mandatory overtime”), declaration of andre holmes, exhibit 3, appendix to eeoc’s brief in opposition (docket no., ¶ 6 (“in july 2002, after both plants were shut down, the machine shop began operating in a 100% situation. this meant that the machine shop operated 24 hours a day and seven days a week requiring mandatory overtime for everyone in this plant”). in concluding that this factual issue was undisputed, therefore, the court viewed the facts in the light most favorable to the eeoc as non-movant. changing its position on the 100% overtime issue in seeking reconsideration, the eeoc now relies on different evidence on which it did not rely before, including portions of the deposition of sharene tyler and gregory hulen. however, the eeoc did not include these 12 particular pages of tyler’s deposition (pages 63-64 and or hulen’s deposition (pages 16- with the previous briefs it submitted in opposition to bosch’s motion. in further support of its new position, the eeoc also relies on portions of the deposition of willie dumas. however, this reliance is cumulative, insofar as the same information was supposedly included in tyler’s deposition, which the eeoc did previously have but failed to present the relevant portions in response to bosch’s motion. under the circumstances, the eeoc can hardly fault the court for viewing the facts in the eeoc’s favor at the time of its ruling. the eeoc now also argues that the court “mistakenly concluded” that no volunteers could be found to cover for carter on his sabbath. however, the evidence cited by the eeoc in support of its motion for reconsideration does not create an issue of fact regarding the existence of willing and able volunteers. even the “new” evidence on which the eeoc in part relies – portions of the deposition of former union steward willie dumas – indicates that the union did not find volunteers. the court did not err in its conclusion that the evidence did not create a genuine issue of fact because it failed to show that other employees were both willing and able to volunteer for carter on his sabbath. the eeoc also expresses the view that the court was under a mistaken “impression” that the union had generated a list of volunteers but failed to present the list to bosch before carter was fired. in its decision, the court did refer to hearsay testimony by carter that he had been told by union bargaining committee member andre holmes that the union had a “list” of employees who might be willing or able to work. opinion and order at however, the court followed this reference with another reference to holmes’ actual testimony, in which he confirmed that he 13 personally never tried to find anyone to work overtime for carter between july and september, id. because the eeoc takes the position that no list even existed (if at all) until after carter was fired, it is unclear why the eeoc raises the issue of the supposed list in its current motion, except perhaps to point out that holmes, who was not a union steward in the machine shop, was unlikely to have been involved in the actual process of procuring volunteers in that area. eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration at 26 n. the “new” testimony of union steward dumas confirms that he never procured a list of volunteers. in addition, the only evidence of a purported “volunteer list” the eeoc presented was an unsigned list of persons who had supposedly volunteered to work for carter, composed after he was fired, which included persons who were qualified to work in the foundry, not in the machine shop where carter worked at the time of his termination. exhibit 31, eeoc’s supplemental brief in opposition (docket no. the eeoc has not presented either affidavits or testimony by these employees to confirm whether they would in fact have been willing and able to work carter’s sabbath shifts in the machine shop.8 in sum, the court was not under any mistaken impression about the availability of volunteers. finally, the eeoc argues that the court “mistakenly found” that company human resources representative benson james “involved himself” in efforts to accommodate carter. according to the eeoc, the court “misunderstood” the “dialogue” between the union and james. eeoc’s brief in support of motion for reconsideration at however, the eeoc 8as the court has already observed, see note 6 infra., the eeoc has neglected to cite to supposed “evidence” identifying volunteers. 14 points to no actual mistake of fact, nor does it show how correction of this supposed mistake requires a different disposition. clearly, there was a dialogue between the union and bosch, as part of which james expressed the company’s willingness to accommodate carter through an arrangement similar to that which had been made when carter was employed in the foundry. the question presented by bosch’s motion was whether bosch had shown that it offered carter a reasonable accommodation, not whether the company initiated a dialogue with the union, or whether the company should have engaged in more dialogue with the union and offered additional accommodations. the eeoc’s argument does not provided a basis for reconsideration of the court’s ruling. conclusion as the majority noted in smith, undoubtedly, one means of accommodating an employee who is unable to work on a particular day due to religious convictions is to allow the employee to trade work shifts with another qualified employee. other circuits have held that when an employer allows such a trade, it has reasonably accommodated its employee. 827 f.2d at 1088 (citing brener v. diagnostic center hosp., 671 f.2d 141, 146 (5th cir. and united states v. albuquerque, 545 f.2d 110, 114 (10th cir. ), see also moore, 727 f. supp. at 1160 (concluding “that the system of voluntary swaps instituted by the defendants was a reasonable accommodation, ” noting existence of “considerable authority to support this position”) (citations omitted). an employer has met its obligation when it demonstrates that it has offered a reasonable accommodation to the employee. ansonia, 479 u.s. at 69, 107 s.ct. at the eeoc and carter have simply failed to show that a genuine issue of fact remains whether the accommodation offered – seeking qualified volunteers to work for carter – was 15 reasonable, as it generally is under the law. because the plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor have not convinced the court that it erred as a matter of law in granting bosch’s motion for summary judgment, the court denies their motions for reconsideration. so ordered this 28th day of april, /s/ wendell a. miles wendell a. miles senior u.s. district judge 16 uni1ed states district court for the wes1ern district of michigan n

equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc) brought title vii religious discrimination case against employer on behalf of employee who was discharged for unexcused absences on his day of worship. the united states district court for the western district of michigan granted summary judgment for employer. holding, the court of appeals, merritt, circuit judge, held that fact question as to what employer was willing to do to accommodate employee precluded summary judgment. *943 on appeal from the united states district court for the western district of michigan. attorneys and law firms susan l. starr, equal employment opportunity commission, office of general counsel, washington, dc, omar weaver, equal employment opportunity commission, detroit district office, detroit, mi, for plaintiff-appellant. michael j. sheehan, connelly, sheehan & moran, chicago, il, for defendant-appellee. before, merritt, martin, and gilman, circuit judges. this is a religious discrimination case under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964, as amended in 1972, 42 u.s.c. § 2000e(j), brought by the eeoc on behalf of jeff carter, who was discharged by the defendant bosch (an automobile parts manufacturer), on september 16, 2002, after four unexcused absences on saturdays, his day of worship. the only question presented on appeal is whether the employer has “demonstrated, ” within the meaning of the statute, “that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee’s ... religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” the district court granted summary judgment for the company, holding that there is no dispute of material facts about carter’s claim that bosch unreasonably refused to accommodate the employee’s religion. we conclude that there is a factual dispute about bosch’s willingness to “reasonably accommodate” carter’s “religious observance, ” and that the district court erred in holding as a matter of law that the employer had carried its burden in showing that it reasonably accommodated its business to carter’s religious observance. i. carter, the employee, was employed by bosch for 25 years beginning in july 1977, and until january 2002 worked in the foundry casting parts. he was a member of the old path church of god, which observes its sabbath from sundown on friday until sundown on saturday. throughout the 25-year period the company, through one of its supervisors, accommodated carter’s desire not to work on his sabbath by finding volunteers when necessary. in april 2002, carter was able to bid for a position on the third shift in the machine shop where he was initially scheduled to work sunday through thursday, thus avoiding any conflict with his religious beliefs. then in july of 2002, for business reasons resulting from a “temporary plant shut-down, ” the machine shop went in a so-called “100% situation” in which it was operating 24 hours a day seven days a week, and each person was assigned to work overtime. as a result, carter was assigned a mandatory overtime shift from *944 11, 00 p.m. on friday to 7, 00 a.m. on saturday, obviously in conflict with his sabbath observance. the company put 1 e.e.o.c. v. robert bosch corp., 169 fed.appx. 942 ( the burden on carter and his union to find a substitute. they were unable to do so, and carter was fired. following unsuccessful negotiations regarding carter’s return to work, this litigation ensued. carter now appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of bosch. a. we review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. nat’l enters., inc. v. smith, 114 f.3d 561, 563 (6th cir.. summary judgment is appropriate where “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” id. we must take the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. brumbalough v. camelot care ctrs., inc., 427 f.3d 996, 1000 (6th cir.. b. following an employee’s establishment of a prima facie case of religious discrimination, see smith v. pyro mining co., 827 f.2d 1081, 1085 (6th cir., 42 u.s.c. § 2000e(j) puts the burden on the employer “to ( conclusively rebut one or more elements of the plaintiff’s prima facie case, ( show that it offered a reasonable accommodation, or ( show that it was unable reasonably to accommodate the employee’s religious needs without undue hardship.” thomas v. nat’l ass’n of letter carriers, 225 f.3d 1149, 1156 (10th cir., see also smith, 827 f.2d at it is undisputed that carter has established a prima facie case of discrimination. the only issue on appeal is whether there was a material dispute of fact about whether bosch reasonably accommodated carter’s religious beliefs. the reasonableness of an employer’s attempt at accommodation must be determined on a case-by-case basis and is generally a question of fact for the jury, rather than a question of law for the court. see smith, 827 f.2d at 1085, redmond v. gaf corp., 574 f.2d 897, 902-03 (7th cir., eeoc v. ibp, inc., 824 f.supp. 147, 153 (c.d.ill.. in general, “one means of accommodating an employee who is unable to work on a particular day due to religious convictions is to allow the employee to trade work shifts with another qualified employee.” smith, 827 f.2d at 1088, see also debbie n. kaminer, title vii’s failure to provide meaningful and consistent protection of religious employees, proposals for an amendment, 21 berkeley j. emp. l. 575, 605 ( (citing cases). merely granting employees permission to find volunteers to swap shifts, however, does not definitively constitute “reasonable accommodation” as a matter of law in all cases. in smith, 827 f.2d at 1088, this court held that such an arrangement was not a reasonable accommodation because the employee believed that it was a sin to ask another to work for him. similarly, in mcguire v. gen. motors corp., 956 f.2d 607, 610 (6th cir. (per curiam), our court held that a jury question existed as to whether allowing voluntary shift swaps constituted reasonable accommodation in light of the employer’s circulation of surveys that allegedly made it “virtually impossible” to find replacements. in addition to allowing voluntary shift swaps, some employers have curried favor with affirmative actions like holding meetings with the employee, attempting to find the employee another job, supplying the employee with a roster sheet containing the schedules of co-workers, and allowing the employee to advertise his need for shift *945 swaps during daily roll calls and on the employer’s bulletin board. see trans world airlines, inc. v. hardison, 432 u.s. 63, 77, 97 s.ct. 2264, 53 l.ed.2d 113 (, beadle v. hillsborough county sheriff’s dep’t, 29 f.3d 589, 593 (11th cir., cowan v. gilless, no. 95-5679, 1996 wl 145873, at *1 (6th cir. on the other hand, “a week-to-week, wait-and-see posture” amounts to no accommodation at all. eeoc v. arlington transit mix, inc., 957 f.2d 219, 222 (6th cir.. nor is the statute satisfied by “an ad hoc arrangement contemplating that the inevitable collision between [the employee’s] religious beliefs and the company’s new work schedule would be dealt with when it arose.” id. this court has also made clear that “[a]n employer who permits an employee to avoid mandatory sabbath work only by using accrued vacation does not ‘reasonably accommodate’ the employee’s religious beliefs.” cooper v. oak rubber co., 15 f.3d 1375, 1379 (6th cir.. the instant case presents a genuine dispute of material fact as to what bosch was willing to do in order to accommodate carter. according to carter, the only thing that the employer was willing to do was to let carter and the union try to find someone who would work additional overtime. it is unclear exactly what the company was willing to do with respect to “swapping” overtime with other employees. some of the evidence suggests that the company did nothing more than allow carter to find another employee who would agree to work additional overtime. the eeoc maintains that the employer did not permit carter to “swap shifts, ” and that in granting the summary judgment the district court “overlooks the 2 e.e.o.c. v. robert bosch corp., 169 fed.appx. 942 ( evidence that bosch officials on at least two occasions stated that a shift swap would not be permitted in the machine shop.” appellant’s final brief at according to the eeoc, the employer’s policy was designed only to identify employees willing to work additional shifts but not to swap shifts. “because persons willing to work additional shifts are not necessarily the same as those willing to swap their overtime shift with an overtime shift of another worker, the procedures bosch provided were inadequate.” id. at 21- there appears to be a factual conflict about whether bosch was only willing to allow carter to find volunteers willing to take on carter’s overtime, or to find volunteers who would “swap” overtime shifts. there seems to be no dispute that the company itself was unwilling to try to find swaps or substitutes for carter. carter, the eeoc and the union claim that as a result of the across-the-board overtime requirement, many employees complained and sought relief from the company. the company’s uniform response was to require the employee to find someone else to work the overtime. it apparently made no distinction between carter and others who had no religious reasons for asking for an accommodation. on pages 111 and 112 of the appendix, the union steward, who also worked in the machine shop, sharene tyler, states that the employer through the representative of the company’s human resources department, benson james, would not allow shift swapping to help carter on his overtime shift and that the company apparently would not allow “out of class” (meaning the foundry or other departments than the machine shop) swaps. the union steward says that bosch would not seek or assist in seeking workers from other departments who qualified for carter’s overtime work, nor would the employer try to find employees of the machine shop to swap the overtime shift with carter. benson james does not appear to deny this. benson james declined to have a meeting with the *946 union and carter to try to reach some accommodation. he simply put the question of accommodation on the shoulders of the union and carter. that much is clear from benson’s e-mail found on page 297 of the appendix. in light of the conflicting evidence about what the company was willing to do to accommodate carter’s sabbath observance, we must reverse the summary judgment and remand the case to the district court for trial. the plaintiff has asked for a jury trial on factual issues. based on the dispute of fact about how far the company was willing to go to help carter observe his sabbath, the jury should be allowed to determine these issues. it should be allowed also to determine the factual question of whether the employer has met the terms of the statute by demonstrating “that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee’s ... religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” accordingly, it is so ordered. parallel citations 2006 wl 406296

       "       'US v City of Fort Lauderdale\\n\\nPage 1 of 11\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA Case No. 02-60652-Civ-GRAHAM/GARBER\\nELGIN O. JONES,\\nPlaintiff,\\nV.\\nCITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA,\\nDefendant.\\n__________________________________________\\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\\nPlaintiff,\\nv.\\nCITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA,\\nDefendant.\\n__________________________________________\\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\\nThis action, originally filed as Case No. 02-61262 and later consolidated with Case No. 02-60652, was brought by the United States of America (\"United States\") against the City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida (\"the Defendant\") to enforce the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., as amended (\"Title VII\"), following receipt by the Department of Justice from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") of a timely charge of discrimination filed by Elgin O. Jones (Charge No. 15A-98-0317). Title VII applies to the Defendant because it is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a), and an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f) and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345.\\nIn its complaint, the United States alleges that the Defendant has discriminated against Mr. Jones in violation of Sections 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a) by, inter alia:\\na. failing or refusing to promote Mr. Jones to the position of Engineering Inspector I in February 1998 because of his race;\\nb. subjecting Mr. Jones to harassment that adversely affected the terms, conditions, and privileges of his employment because he opposed employment practices by the Defendant that he reasonably believed to be unlawful practices on the basis of race, filed an internal complaint of discrimination with the Defendant, and filed a charge of discrimination with\\n\\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/emp/documents/ftlauderdalecd.htm\\n\\n8/13/2007\\n\\n\\x0cUS v City of Fort Lauderdale\\n\\nPage 2 of 11\\n\\nthe EEOC, Charge No. 15A-98-0317; and\\nc. failing or refusing to take appropriate action to remedy fully the effects of the discrimination against Mr. Jones.\\nMr. Jones eventually was promoted to the position of Engineering Inspector I in September 1998, but did not receive back pay or other relief.\\nThe Defendant denies the United States\\' allegations and further denies that it engages in or has engaged in any unlawful employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of Title VII. The Defendant asserts that it is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity and voluntarily enters into this settlement agreement. The Defendant\\'s signature on this agreement should in no way be viewed as an admission of liability under Title VII.\\nDesiring that this action be settled by an appropriate settlement agreement and without the burden of protracted litigation, the parties agree to this Court\\'s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of this action. Subject to the approval of this settlement by the Court, the parties waive, for the purposes of this settlement agreement, hearings and findings of fact and conclusions of law. This settlement agreement is a full, final, and complete resolution of all claims alleged in the United States\\' complaint, and the United States agrees not to further pursue those claims. Each party shall bear its own attorney\\'s fees and costs. The parties accept this settlement agreement as final and binding between themselves as to the issues resolved herein.\\nIt is therefore agreed as follows:\\nGENERAL CONDITIONS\\n1. The Defendant agrees not to engage in any act that unlawfully discriminates against any employee or potential employee because of that individual\\'s race.\\n2. The Defendant agrees that it will not retaliate against any person in a manner prohibited by § 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), because that person:\\na. made an internal complaint of discrimination; b. filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, the Florida Commission on Human Relations, or the Broward County Human Rights Division; c. participated in or cooperated with the initiation, investigation, litigation or administration of this settlement agreement; or d. provided information to the Department of Justice.\\n3. Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this settlement agreement, the Defendant will post notices in the form attached hereto as Appendix A. Such notices will be posted in a prominent and conspicuous location or locations used for posting notices in City Hall and in the Department of Public Services. Such notices will remain posted for a period of ninety (90) days after the date of execution of this settlement agreement.\\n4. Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this settlement agreement, the Defendant will revisethe City of Fort Lauderdale\\'s Policy and Standards Manual, Chapter 14, Section 1, entitled \"Prohibition of Unlawful Discrimination and Harassment in the Workplace,\" as set forth in Appendix B, hereto, and will provide to the United States documentation that these revisions have been made. The\\n\\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/emp/documents/ftlauderdalecd.htm\\n\\n8/13/2007\\n\\n\\x0cUS v City of Fort Lauderdale\\n\\nPage 3 of 11\\n\\nDefendant\\'s anti-discrimination policieswill make clear that the Defendantwill take into account compliance with these policies, including City of Fort Lauderdale Policy and Standards Manual, Chapter 14, Section 1, entitled \"Prohibition of Unlawful Discrimination and Harassment in the Workplace,\" in conducting performance evaluations for all City employees and when deciding whether an employee should receive a promotion, award, or other performance-related benefit.\\n5. If the Defendant finds that any of its employees has engaged in discrimination or retaliation in violation of Title VII, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a City employee has engaged in actions made unlawful by Title VII, the City shall, at a minimum, place a letter in the employee\\'s personnel file documenting the employee\\'s failure to comply withthe Defendant\\'santidiscrimination policy and/or federal law.\\n6. The City will post anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies in a prominent and conspicuous location or locations used for posting notices in City Halland in the Department of Public Services.\\nANTI-DISCRIMINATION TRAINING\\n7. The Defendant will arrange for a mandatory live training for all employees, including supervisors, in the Distribution and Collection Division of the City of Fort Lauderdale\\'s Department of Public Services regarding Title VII\\'s prohibitions against racial discrimination, retaliation, and harassment because an employee has engaged in activity protected by Title VII. This training will be completed by December 31, 2003, in a manner that accommodates the Defendant\\'s operational needs. The Defendant also will arrange for a mandatory live training regarding Title VII\\'s prohibitions for the Executive Management Team (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Internal Auditor, Director of Administrative Services, City Manager, Assistant City Managers, Finance Director, Director of Parks and Recreation, Director of Communications, Public Services Director, City Clerk, Police Chief, and Fire Chief); employees working in the Office of Professional Standards (which is responsible for reviewing or investigating discrimination complaints); and other employees with managerial responsibility for personnel and human resources matters (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Employee Relations Director, Assistant Employee Relations Director, Employment Manager, Personnel Director, Classifications and Compensation Manager, and Director of Organizational Training and Development). All persons required to attend this live training will sign an attendance verification sheet. The Defendant will maintain a copy of the attendance verification sheet in each attendee\\'s personnel file as long as this settlement agreement remains in effect. The United States and the Defendant will confer and agree on who will administer this training, and the Defendant will bear the costs of such training.\\na. None of the employees, managers, or supervisors specified herein will be exempted from this mandatory live training except for an approved absence. Notwithstanding an approved absence, the Defendant will require any employee or supervisor who is unable to attend the live training to watch a video replay, administered by the Defendant, within two weeks thereafter or as soon as practicable. All employees attending the video replay session will sign a training attendance verification sheet. The Defendant will maintain a copy of this training attendance verification sheet in the employee\\'s personnel file as long as this agreement remains in effect.\\nb. After the live training session, for the life of this agreement, the Defendant will conduct annual training via the internet, by video, or other means, regarding Title VII\\'s prohibitions against racial discrimination and retaliation, for all employees of the Distribution and Collection Division of the City\\'s Department of Public Services (or its successor, if the\\n\\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/emp/documents/ftlauderdalecd.htm\\n\\n8/13/2007\\n\\n\\x0cUS v City of Fort Lauderdale\\n\\nPage 4 of 11\\n\\nname of this entity is changed while this settlement agreement remains in effect); the Executive Management Team (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Internal Auditor, Director of Administrative Services, City Manager, Assistant City Managers, Finance Director, Director of Parks and Recreation, Director of Communications, Public Services Director, City Clerk, Police Chief, and Fire Chief); employees working in the Office of Professional Standards (which is responsible for reviewing or investigating discrimination complaints); and other employees with managerial responsibility for personnel and human resources matters (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Employee Relations Director, Assistant Employee Relations Director, Employment Manager, Personnel Director, Classifications and Compensation Manager, and Director of Organizational Training and Development). The Defendant will require every person required to attend the annual training to sign a statement certifying that he or she has received, understands, and will comply with the antidiscrimination and anti-harassment provision of Title VII. The Defendant will maintain a copy of this certification in each attendee\\'s personnel file as long as this settlement agreement remains in effect.\\n\\nINDIVIDUAL RELIEF\\n\\n8.\\n\\nBecause the Defendant and Plaintiff Elgin Jones have reached a separate settlement agreement\\n\\nin this case, which includes a monetary settlement to be paid to Mr. Jones, the Defendant is not required\\n\\nto provide individual relief to Mr. Jones as part of this settlement agreement between the Defendant and\\n\\nthe United States. Payment to Mr. Jones of the monetary relief specified in the Defendant\\'s agreement\\n\\nwith Mr. Jones fully satisfies all of the United States\\' claims for individual relief for Mr. Jones that were\\n\\nor could have been alleged in the United States\\' complaint. The Defendant agrees to provide the United\\n\\nStates with copies of the checks evidencing payment to Mr. Jones within ten (10) calendar days after\\n\\nsuch payment is made.\\n\\nDISPUTES\\n\\n9.\\n\\nBefore either party may move the Court for resolution of a dispute under this settlement\\n\\nagreement, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve informally any disputes that may occur\\n\\nunder this settlement agreement. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after\\n\\na matter has been brought to the attention of either party by the other party, the issue may be submitted\\n\\nto the Court for resolution. This settlement agreement between the United States and the Defendant is\\n\\nnot intended to confer rights on any organization or individual not a party to this case, nor does it\\n\\nprevent the Defendant from raising in any later lawsuit any defense otherwise available under Title VII.\\n\\nRECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING BY THE CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE\\n\\n10. Throughout the term of this settlement agreement, the Defendant will fill any vacancies for the position of Engineering Inspector I through its testing processes and without regard to the race of any applicant.\\n\\n11.

Class action is being discriminated against in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and the pregnancy discrimination act (pda) at&t corp. (\"at&t\") for offering and/or providing health insurance that does not cover prescription contraceptives for women related to reproduction while covering sex-related prescription medication for men . If plaintiff became pregnant, however, the plan would have covered the costs of either an abortion or continuing the pregnancy to term . Unwanted pregnancy poses far greater health risks to women and children than does intended pregnancy . Contraceptive options should be discussed with all women over the age of 13 during routine primary care assessments . The average risk of death from pregnancy is 1 in 11, 000 while the risk of death for contraception is much less . Birth control pills are medically contraindicated for smokers over age 35 and women who are at risk of cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart attack, blood clots, and hypertension . Plaintiff bought and paid for prescription contraceptives on at least one occasion for which a timely charge could be filed . Ruling was distinguished in cooley and union pacific, but has been relied on as a bar to pda claims regarding prescription contraceptives in cummins and wright . i will deny defendant's motion for summary judgment , but has been relying on this ruling:  It has been relied upon aspired to exclude plaintiffs’rulping . Defendant contends this case may be used only by workers around the globe; it must yield to avoid unnecessary medical procedures like birth control pills were meant to protect its own employees . At & t offered plans covering prescribed contraceptives for management employees, but has since been relied on 'a bar to ogbouche . In 2002 at & t offers plans covering prescriptions for management employees,. but only on a mail-order basis . Some qualified claimants, like plaintiff herself, will not be entitled to damages, except as to the new mail-order limitations . Plaintiffs will not be able to afford to pay for their alleged contraceptive provisions .

       "\"On January 23, 2004, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 2000e(k), against AT&T Corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, was a former AT&T employee and asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that AT&T's health insurance policy discriminated against women.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendant's health insurance plan, which did not provide prescription contraceptives (birth control) before 2002 and only through the mail after 2002, violated female employees' civil rights.\\n\\nThe action originally started in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, but was transferred to Missouri on May 12, 2003.  This is the date on which the docket begins.  Originally, there were two plaintiffs on the case, but one dropped out of the litigation.  Thus, a single plaintiff carried forth the case.\\n\\nOn September 3, 2004, the Court (Judge Sachs) denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification.  In the opinion, the Court barely discussed the requirements for a class-action lawsuit, except to point out typicality.  The plaintiff, since the suit began, had stopped taking birth control and was seeking to get pregnant.  Therefore, the Court declared that a class could not be certified without a class representative who would have an ongoing interest in the prayed-for relief.  The plaintiff wanted to recover her past expenditures on the prescribed contraceptives.  The Women's Law project came onto the case as an amicus.  After a lengthy discovery period, the Court made another ruling.\\n\\nOn June 7, 2006, the Court (Judge Sachs) granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification as to the damages in the complaint.  The class was comprised of female employees of AT&T, who paid for their own prescription contraception from the dates of October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002.  The Court did not certify the claims for injunctive or declaratory relief because as of 2002, the health insurance provider covered birth control through mail order. While the cost of the plaintiff's potential recovery was relatively small, $68.07, the class action potential in the litigation, given AT&T's size made both parties fight vigorously.  According to the docket, neither side was content with this decision.  The plaintiff wanted the period of time for damages claims to be extended, and the defendant did not approve of the decision at all.  Ultimately, the plaintiffs filed an appeal.  \\n\\nOn June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a preliminary judgment to the District Court (Judge Sachs).  The Circuit Court advised the District Court to review the findings of another recent case, In Re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2007).  This case featured a ruling that was fundamentally at odds with the decision of the District Court on June 7, 2006.\\n\\nOn October 22, 2007, the District Court (Judge Sachs) vacated its previous decision, and ordered a decision in favor of the defendant.  The case was closed the next day on October 23, 2007.\\n\\n\""
